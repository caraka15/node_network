OBT Season 1 — Just remember two things: download OverNode and complete the missions given in the app.

1. Before you start, follow [the official OverNode X account](https://twitter.com/lightfullnodes). You can check all announcements here during the testnet period.
1. Starting from **Wednesday, December 13th**, anyone can download OverNode without any barriers from the official website. The estimated UTC time will be announced through the official OverNode X account.
1. For eligibility purposes, the same account used in OverWallet will also be utilized on OverNode. Points in the OverWallet are crucial for participating as a validator. Participants starting with a threshold of 30,000 points will receive OVER(for testing). This requirement may lowered to 10,000 points.
1. Even if you meet the eligibility criteria, you might miss out on receiving OVER(for testing) if you act too late. Therefore, please keep up with our announcements to stay informed.
1. Not eligible? Don’t worry! **Here’s an exciting tip**: If you receive OVER(for testing) from someone who already has it, you can complete the missions! Look for a member of [the OverNode community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1711969874950635846) who is willing to transfer OVER(for testing) to you.
1. ***OBT Season 1* will end on December 22nd**. You can see the countdown in the app 48 hours before it ends. From this point, you can participate in the satisfaction survey. Your feedback will be a great help in preparing for the next season!
1. Above are all you need to know, as the app will provide clear and simple guidance on how to participate in the missions. However, for your convenience, we will briefly review the seven types of missions for you.

**#1 Verify Email** 🔐 #2**
Verify your email to start using OverNode.

- Download and open the app. To access the main screen, verify with your OverWallet signup email. You’ll get OVER(for testing) based on your points after verification.
- If you meet the eligibility requirements at any time, you will automatically receive OVER(for testing) during the testnet period. However, remember that it’s on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Completing Mission #1 will unlock Mission #2.

**#2 Link to OverWallet** 🔐 #3, #4**
Change your node’s profile image using the wallet.

- Follow the guide to complete the missions. The data, including the profile image of OverNode, is synchronized with that of OverWallet.
- Completing Mission #2 will unlock Mission #3 and #4.

**#3 Be a Validator** 🔐 #7**
Become a validator by staking 256 OVER(for testing).

- If you have sufficient OVER(for testing) to become a validator, try Mission #3️. Be aware that if there are many participants and the queue is full, the waiting time could be lengthy.
- Completing Mission #3 will unlock Mission #7.

**#4 Transfer OVER(for testing)** 🔐 ️#5**
Use the ‘Send’ feature to transfer OVER(for testing).

- Sending it to yourself will not be counted as successful completion of a mission.
- Seek out a member of [the OverNode community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1711969874950635846) to whom you can transfer OVER(for testing). Anyone with an OverNode account can receive it.
- Completing Mission #4 will unlock Mission #5.

**#5 Sneak Peek OverView** 🔐 ️#6**
Discover more information on OverView.

- OverView is an essential tool for exploring data within OverProtocol. Welcome this new companion you’ll frequently encounter in the future.
- Completing Mission #5 will unlock Mission #6.

**#6 to Survive or to Revive**
Restore Ethanosed accounts, or avoid Ethanos.

- What’s Ethanos — When an account has been inactive for a while, Over Protocol considers it inactive and removes it from the valid dataset. In this testnet, if your account remains inactive for 48 hours (approximately 6 months on the mainnet), it will be ethanosed.
- Missions count as successful if you achieve either 🅰️ or 🅱️
- 🅰️ Survive — Keep Active for 3 Days: To avoid Ethanos, maintain daily activity by sending and receiving OVER(for testing) for 3 consecutive days. This consistent activity will prevent your account from being ethanosed and count as a success.
- 🅱️ Revive — Restoring a Ethanosed Account: If your account has been ethanosed, you will receive a notification in the bottom right corner of the node screen. Click the ‘Restore’ button in this notification to revive your account and complete the mission.

**#7 Be the Best Validator Operator**
Keep your validators in top conditions.

- Maintain your validator operational 24/7 to achieve optimal performance and maximize your total income. The scores and rankings will be factored into the airdrop amount.
- This mission ends with the close of the Testnet.

**#Bonus Share your know-how**
Keep your validator running smoothly 24/7 and share your know-how on social media (YouTube, blogs, Instagram, etc.).

- Submit the link to your content through the Google Form(To be announced) when the testnet ends.
- We’ll send the official OverProtocol merchandise set (hoodie, t-shirt, cap, stickers, reusable bag) to up to 10 people who provide valuable content to the community.
